# Algorithm assignment for R****.*z
  
This repo contains a Jupyter notebook with a K-means  
algorithm imitation. The objective was to cluster location  
data, measure the quality of the clusters, and visualize  
the results.  
  
Sample JSON files were provided to evaluate the built  
algorithm.  
  
Disclaimer: I do not own the JSON data.
