# K-Means Algorithm from Scratch

This repo contains a Jupyter Notebook containing my version of the famous K-Means algorithm.  
While there is no need for a hand coded implementatin, this attempt was made as a *fun* challenge for myself.  
This is a very simple version, since initial cluster locations are **randomly** chosen. A better solution  
would implement K-Means++ instead.  
    
My objective was to cluster sample JSON location data, measure the quality of the clusters, and visualize the results.  
The solution was based on personal experience and online classes on the topic from the University of Washington.  
  
The number of clusters was determined through the classical elbow method. It has recently come to my attention that  
it is no longer the preferred way. Therefore, an improvement to this project could include this issue.
  
Disclaimer: I do not own the JSON data.
